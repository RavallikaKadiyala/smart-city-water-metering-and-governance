# smart-city-water-metering-and-governance
This project focuses on developing a smart water metering system for urban areas, aiming to improve water usage efficiency and governance. By analyzing historical water consumption data, the project uses machine learning models to predict consumption patterns, optimize billing accuracy, and enhance resource management. The goal is to provide insights for better water distribution, reduce wastage, and support sustainable water practices in smart cities. The project also includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model comparisons for improved decision-making in water metering and billing systems.
